You’ve done your research and chosen your market. Now let us help you solidify and expand your position by designing advertising materials that speak to your customer’s needs and wants.

949 Graphic Design is committed to the Small Business Community of Orange County. We live here. We play here. We shop here. Whether you need a new or redesigned logo, company identity package, newspaper, magazine or yellow pages ad, sales brochure or other collateral material, we can help. We can also assist you by designing or redesigning an informational web site to help create and maintain the image that you are looking for.

Our system is simple. We work one-on-one with you to help focus your advertising materials on your customer’s needs and wants. We'll guide you step-by-step through the entire process from the analysis and design of your materials to the presentation and delivery of the finished work in the exact form that is needed by you and your printer, advertising representative or web hosting company.

The process starts with a free phone or e-mail consultation about your current position, goals and marketing direction as well as a free written estimate.</p>
